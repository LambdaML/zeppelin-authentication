Zeppelin Authentication with Docker
===================================

[Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/) is a notebook for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).  Zeppelin doesn't support authentication, a requirement for multi-user environments.  This is an attempt to use nginx and Docker containers to provide simple password-basd authentication.
